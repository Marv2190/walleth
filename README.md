Forked main v37 as a clear line of deprecation for Trezor firmware 1.6.1 support.

I recently bailed out a bunch of coin from a Trezor with the ill-fated firmware version 1.6.1. Best I can tell, Trezor forced a firmware update due to some fundamental changes in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and demands for support from their users, rendering the older firmwares incapable of properly signing Ethereum transactions. MyEtherWallet, wallet.trezor.io, and other common bridge tools were at some point between June 2018 and March 2019 rendered useless for the purpose of extracting financial value from their trezor, had they not performed the required update.

A friend of mine did just that. A carpenter contractor type whom often found himself away from home on business, quietly HODLing away all he could. Like any of our fellows desirous of the death of the centralized banking systems, he decided a Trezor store was the best place for them. Trezor support, however, was not as kind as we would have hoped, only offering some potential solutions such as vintage.myetherwallet.com, which also now fails to properly sign the transactions like their main app. He needed to extract the coins to update the firmware, but so it seemed he also needed to update the firmware to extract the coin.

Thankfully, reddit threads proved helpful, with the golden average Internet citizen offering sincere help and direction, but much of it mirroring Trezor's lacklustre responses. Lots of focus on the trezorctl (python) project, and building MyEtherWallet locally, to no avail. To both Trezor and redditor's credit, they all had recommendations for WallEth. Fearing the worst with bugs in older versions potentially manhandling the wallets to oblivion, but also knowing the latest version was no longer compatible with firmware 1.6.1, we started digging through the commit changelog hoping for clues, and fixed around the point of Trezor 1.6.1's release. 

To save anyone else out there with ERC20 wallets hopelessly stuck on an old Trezor firmware, I present to you --- what worked for us. We gratefully stand on the shoulders of the Trezor and reddit communities and are happy to let you know there is a (probably time-sensitive) escape from your financial woes. WallEth version 0.37 -released 20180613 -build flavor no-GEth No-Analytics -For-FDroid -OnlineRelease works!


build environment:
Android Studio 3.3.2
Build #AI-182.5107.16.33.5314842, built on February 15, 2019
JRE: 1.8.0_152-release-1248-b01 amd64
JVM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM by JetBrains s.r.o
Windows 10 10.0

instruction (Please bear with me as I am no more than an amateur developer.)
- Install Android Studio
- Install Java RunTime Environment (JRE, traditional end-user Java)
- Install Java SE (JDK)

should work for whatever base platform, Windows/Linux/Mac, though YMMV. 

To make this easier on yourselves, leverage the https://Chocolatey.org platform. They have their simple installation methods posted there.
Once choco is a thing on your machine,  complete the above installations with a one-liner:

choco install -y androidstudio jdk8 jre8  

- probably worth a reboot at this time just to start fresh, as environment variables get changed. 

- Open android studio and follow the generic instruction for setup, where it will start pulling a bunch of base frameworks for building things in the latest version of android.

- back to our task at hand - WallEth v0.37 is built on Oreo 8.0 (SDK 26) so we'll need to pull in that framework as well.
File > Settings > System Settings > Android SDK > Check Android 8.0 and then 'apply'  gits that framework for building this Internet-ancient WallEth.

- Download/git/ssh the version that worked for us (Walleth 0.37 from master branch worked for Trezor 1.6.1)
https://github.com/walleth/walleth/releases/tag/0.37

- unzip the archive somewhere that can host a couple Gig's worth of disk space - the build dependencies are sprawling. 

- Back in android studio, File > New > Import Project. Direct it towards the walleth-0.37 directory from above. AS will start setting itself up to work with the codebase. 

- Once the initial sync is complete, we can build, but it has to be the right build flavor - on the very left-hand border of the Android Studio window you'll find a tab called 'Build Versions' that presents a dropdown menu - select the option for :

NoGEth
NoFirebase
ForFDroid
OnlineRelase

-= GEth is an extension for Walleth that lets us run a full ETH node - awesome, but unncessary for this purpose. 

-= FireBase is Google's analytics platform, again unnecessary. 

-= We can't use the Offline version because it won't connect to the mainnet, where we need our blockchain ledger updates written so our coins actually go somewhere.

-= FDroid (FOSS android app store, be sure to send Richard Stallman a coin donation when you recover!) is the only static variable in all the build flavors because at this stage of WallEth development, it was not ready for play store, and we shouldn't/wouldn't be able to sign the code for Play Store inclusion anyways.  


We're halfway out of the woods:

Build > Generate Signed APK. Walk through the prompts.

- create a code signing signature for yourself, save it somewhere you can find it again, and set/remember the password (so you can use the same code sig if you have to go through multiple build processes to get happy.)


- Sign with the v2 method only, v1 is ancient and generally not required. If you're running an android version that requires this you shouldn't be messing with valuable data like crypto on that device and the WallEth app probably won't work.

- Android Studio will try to convince you to install a 'latest APK bundle thingy' - no. don't need it for this, we're not publishing to Play Store.

If today's a good day, you'll get a toast message after a few minutes that build completed. Click 'LOCATE' and your File Browser should open to the walleth-0.37 directory. There will be a directory name there matching the build flavor you'd selected, and inside is an APK. 

Send that APK to your Android device, preferably one running Oreo 8.0 or 8.1. bluetooth, Google drive, USB cable, whatever. Open your File Manager of choice and find the APK, click to install. If prompted that 'for security, this app is prevented from installing other apps' then you'll need to allow that.

If you have a WallEth version installed already, you're going to have to uninstall that first. If you've got a bunch of precious configuration data, perhaps leverage TitaniumBackup if you're rooted. otherwise, move your coins around to get them away from your existing WallEth install, because the current instance must be destroyed to get this v37 version running.

Once you're set with v37 WallEth installed, connect your trezor to your android with USB OTG cable, or leverage a Micro-Male or C-Male to USB-B-femal adapter. (adapter's male goes in the android port, your cable goes between the adapter and the trezor,)


WallEth should recognize your Trezor, allow pin unlock, view wallets, and the value stored on them.

If you're not paranoid about where the code is coming from, or just don't want to fuss with build environments, here's a link to the build that worked for us. It's a build straight from walleth/walleth/main branch, and this is verifiable, only difference is the code signature certificate it's signed with. 

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lHZW1-R6YrdsOrQJLHUz1yv9pfFe8b8b


Send your coin to an address that's explicitly meant for that coin, and one you control. Binance, BitStamp, CoinBase are all decent intermediaries until you've got your Trezor updated to the latest firmware and ready to receive the transfers back onto it. 

I'd recommend sending VERY SMALL amounts of coin at first, as a few test cases, wait for the full node validation to complete, and move on from there. Even if all the software you're running is perfectly tuned, after all's said and done the tubes can corrupt or drop data transfers sometimes.

BE ABSOLUTELY SURE to uninstall version 37 or whatever other ancient alpha build you're working with once you've recovered your gear. It's strongly urged to keep up with the latest version for compatibility and security purposes. 


I'd be happy to collect whatever compensation you're willing to share for my troubles:

ETHEREUM ETC ONLY ADDRESS: 0x4Ea515dDfc03D833fDC202393621A89AB77F1D87

but be sure to tip the WallEth folks, listed as suggested reciever addreses within the app.
